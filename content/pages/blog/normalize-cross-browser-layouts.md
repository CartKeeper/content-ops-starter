Every browser ships with its own default stylesheet, and those tiny differences in margin, padding, or box-sizing can wreck the
pixel-perfect layout you built in one engine when it lands in another. If your header looks snug in Chrome but the widgets
slide off the canvas in Safari, start by normalizing the playing field before chasing down component bugs.

## 1. Reset the Box Model

Browsers still default to `content-box`, which calculates element width without padding or border. When you mix padding and
percentage-based widths, the math diverges across engines. Opt in to `border-box` everywhere so padding is included inside the
box:

```css
/* Apply consistent box model */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This single rule eliminates most mysterious overflow because every element now measures itself the same way in Chrome, Safari,
and Firefox.

## 2. Clear Out User-Agent Margins

The `<body>`, headings, and lists pick up default spacing that varies by browser. Remove it so you can control spacing from your
component styles:

```css
html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

Do the same for other structural elements if they keep nudging layouts out of alignment.

## 3. Constrain and Center Your Container

Without explicit widths, flex or grid wrappers can stretch differently across browsers. Give your main container predictable
bounds and consistent breathing room:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 1200px; /* swap in your breakpoint */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding: 0 16px;
}
```

`auto` margins center the wrapper, while side padding prevents content from hugging the viewport edges on small screens.

## 4. Align Flexbox Headers the Same Way Everywhere

Safari can appear to "lose" widgets when flex children are free to grow. Lock down the alignment logic and give each region a
role so both desktop and mobile stay organized:

```css
.header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.header .left {
  flex: 1;
}

.header .right {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

Setting `gap` instead of manual margins keeps spacing uniform, and `flex: 1` on the left block ensures the right-side widgets
have room without forcing them off-screen.

## 5. Nail the Viewport Meta Tag

Safari in particular treats viewport units differently if the meta tag is missing or configured oddly. Make sure your HTML head
contains the baseline responsive directive:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This tells mobile browsers to match the layout viewport to the device width, preventing unexpected zooming or scaling.

## Debug Like a Pro

* In DevTools, inspect the box model for the misbehaving element in each browser. Chrome and Firefox will show you if an extra
  margin or scroll width is creeping in.
* If a child keeps overflowing its flex parent, give it `flex: 0 0 auto` or set an explicit `max-width` to stop runaway growth.
* Compare computed styles side-by-side. When fonts or widgets "shoot off to the right," it's almost always a width calculation
  difference or leftover padding you forgot to reset.

Normalize once, and you can spend the rest of your debugging time on actual product behavior instead of chasing inconsistent
browser defaults.
